# android-photo-recovery-non-root
The program comes from my archive! (I wrote it a long time ago, my programming style has already changed.)  A program that extracts imgcache.0 files from android smartphones.  This file contains copies of photos from the gallery. The program is old, but even today you can find this file under a different name. On Xiaomi remi note 5 pro it is the "MIUI / Gallery / cloud / .cache / photo_blob.x" folder. (you need to rename the file to imgcache.0)  Sometimes it's the only method to recover deleted photos from android device. It does not require ROOT;)
